G16B,G16B20/00,"Embodiments of the present invention provide methods, systems, and apparatus for deducing the fetal DNA fraction in maternal plasma without using paternal or fetal genotypes. Maternal genotype information may be obtained from a maternal-only DNA sample or may be assumed from shallow-depth sequencing of a biological sample having both maternal and fetal DNA molecules. Because sequencing may be at shallow depths, a locus may have only few reads and may fail to exhibit a non-maternal allele even if a non-maternal allele is present. However, normalized parameters that characterize non-maternal alleles sequenced can be used to provide an accurate estimate of the fetal DNA fraction, even if the amount of non-maternal alleles is in error. Methods described herein may not need high-depth sequencing or enrichment of specific regions. As a result, these methods can be integrated into widely used non-invasive prenatal testing and other diagnostics.",10457990,Accurate deduction of fetal DNA fraction with shallow-depth sequencing of maternal plasma,2019

A person will view a simulation of an electrical stimulation current that transmits to an area of the brain they desire to stimulate. Watching the smart brain simulations enables the mind to have a visual perception of the area of the brain to stimulate. So that by using the mind, vision and sense of hearing and touch, we can show the brain where a stimulation should be received within the brain. Also, using this system will allow the individual to have a more personal role in their brain stimulation therapy.

G16B,G16B25/00,"Regulated changes in gene expression underlie many biological processes, but globally profiling cell-to-cell variations in transcriptional regulation is problematic when measuring single cells. Transcriptome-wide identification of regulatory heterogeneities can be robustly achieved by randomly collecting small numbers of cells followed by statistical analysis. However, this stochastic-profiling approach blurs out the expression states of the individual cells in each pooled sample. Various aspects of the disclosure show that the underlying distribution of single-cell regulatory states can be deconvolved from stochastic-profiling data through maximum-likelihood inference. Guided by the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation, the disclosure provides mixture models for cell-to-cell regulatory heterogeneity which result in likelihood functions to infer model parameters. Inferences that validate both computationally and experimentally different mixture models, which include regulatory states for multicellular function occupied by as few as one in 40 cells of the population, are also encompassed. When the disclosed method extends to programs of heterogeneously coexpressed transcripts, the population-level inferences are much more accurate with pooled samples than with one-cell samples when the extent of sampling was limited. The disclosed deconvolution method provides a means to quantify the heterogeneous regulation of molecular states efficiently and gain a deeper understanding of the heterogeneous execution of cell decisions.",10453555,Parameterizing cell-to-cell regulatory heterogeneities via stochastic transcriptional profiles,2019

For a hemizygous deletion, a region can be linked to one or more hets, and the labels for a particular haplotype can be used to identify which reads in the region correspond to which haplotype. In this manner, since the reads for a particular haplotype can be identified, a hemizygous deletion can be determined. Further, a phasing rate of pulses can be used to identify large deletions.

G16B,G16B5/00,"Integrative analysis of metabolites is essential to obtain a comprehensive view of dysregulated biological pathways leading to a disease. Despite the great potential of metabolites their system level analysis has been limited. Global measurements of the metabolites by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) detects metabolites features changing in a disease. However, identification of each feature is a bottleneck in metabolomics, in which a fraction of them are identified via tandem MS. Consequently, the scarcity of these data add additional barriers to decipher their biological meaning, especially in relation to other 'omic data such as proteomics. To address these challenges, a novel network-based approach called PIUMet is described. PIUMet infers dysregulated pathways and components from the differential metabolite features between control and disease systems without the need for the prior identification. The application of PIUMet is demonstrated by integrative analysis of untargeted lipid profiling data of a cell line model of Huntington's disease. The results show that PIUMet inferred dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism in the disease cells. Additionally, PIUMet identified disease-modifying metabolite in the pathway that remained undetected experimentally. Furthermore, the lipidomic data of these cell lines was integrated with global phospho-proteomic ones. Integrative analysis of these data using PIUMet was shown to systematically lead to identifying dysregulated proteins in the disease cells that cannot be distinguished with individual analysis of each dataset.",10446259,"Systems, apparatus, and methods for analyzing and predicting cellular pathways",2019

Topological design data indicates a number of bases in each helix connected to corresponding junctions. Initial positions of each base are determined by connecting helices to junctions using the ground-state geometry and arbitrary coordinates not confined to lattice coordinates. Misalignment vectors each indicate a difference in coordinates and orientations between initial positions of a pair of bases that are not adjacent in the initial positions but are adjacent or coincident in the design data. Forces and moments at the junctions to reduce misalignment magnitudes are determined based on the translational and rotational stiffness coefficients at each junction. Position and orientation in 3D coordinates of each base are determined by reducing or eliminating the misalignment magnitudes and balancing forces and moments across the nanostructure.",10289799,"Techniques for controlling spatial structure of nucleic acid structures based on lattice-free, three dimensional junction coordinates",2019

G16B,G16B20/00,"Analysis of tumor-derived circulating cell-free DNA opens up new possibilities for performing liquid biopsies for solid tumor assessment or cancer screening. However, many aspects of the biological characteristics of tumor-derived cell-free DNA remain unclear. Regarding the size profile of plasma DNA molecules, some studies reported increased integrity of tumor-derived plasma DNA while others reported shorter tumor-derived plasma DNA molecules. We performed an analysis of the size profiles of plasma DNA in patients with cancer using massively parallel sequencing at single base resolution and in a genomewide manner. Tumor-derived plasma DNA molecules were further identified using chromosome arm-level z-score analysis (CAZA). We showed that populations of aberrantly short and long DNA molecules co-existed in the plasma of patients with cancer. The short ones preferentially carried the tumor-associated copy number aberrations. These results show the ability to use plasma DNA as a molecular diagnostic tool.",10364467,Using size and number aberrations in plasma DNA for detecting cancer,2019
