G16H,G16H50/20,"In the present invention, a method and associated system is provided that produces a new sequence of combined X-ray/fluoro images obtained in synchrony with intravascular dataset/images. This synchronization is based on the time tags recorded at the acquisition of one dataset of the X-ray/fluoroscopic images and the intravascular images/datasets and the cardiac cycle correspondence between the combined X-ray/fluoro datasets/images. The combined X-ray/fluoro and intravascular sensor images provided in the method for each position of intravascular measurement/slice along the blood vessel allows the physician the ability to determine the planned position of the treatment, e.g., a stent, in the X-ray/fluoro images based on the intravascular images, and allows an accurate assessment of the target/lesion location in the X-ray/fluoro images during treatment.",10022101,X-ray/intravascular imaging colocation method and system,2018
G16H,G16H40/63,"In a clinical environment, where multiple patients reside at any given time, central patient monitoring stations (10), such as nurses stations exist to consolidate information gathered concerning physiological parameters of the patients. The data is displayed in several panes (22) of a display (18) of the monitoring station (10). Due to certain size limitations of the display (18), it is often difficult to discern the data displayed on the panes (22), or to even display all of the data that is being gathered. A user can enlarge any given pane (22) into a zoomed pane (32) that offers greater functionality of any other pane (22), without completely obscuring, or adjusting the size of any other pane (22).",9898583,Zoom pane for a central monitoring device,2018
